#  ReelRelate : A Movie Recommender-system
A movie Recommender system using content based filtering and cosine similarity 

## Why do we need Recommender System : 

From a business standpoint, the more relevant products a user finds on the platform, the higher their engagement. This often results in increased revenue for the platform itself. Various sources say that as much as 35–40% of tech giants’ revenue comes from recommendations alone.

Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended . 


Project Flow : 1. Data  2. Pre Processing Of Data  3. Model Building  4. Website using streamlit and integration of model 

## DataSet : 
 Movies Dataset contains details of 5k movies .
 Credit dataset contains movies id , title , cast and crew details 

 The data set obtained after pre-processing contains only 3 columns : Movie_id , Title and  Tags

 Vectorization is done using Bag of Words method . For vectorization we have used CountVectorizer function from sklearn .
